## Looping

The goal of this exercise is to loop through the json __once__.

Note: You will need multiple loops, but they should be nested within one another.

There is a `looping.json` file that contains several JSON objects. 
With in them are integers (ex. 1, 2, 3 ...).
Write a program so that it prints out those numbers in series.

> $ node solve-loops.js
>> 1

>> 2

>> 3

>> 4


Try exercised 1 - 5. If you're feeling things are way too easy, try 6. 
It might take more than looping since some arrays contain integers and objects.

As an additional challenge, make your code replace each integer with a letter from the alphabet.
1=A, 2=B, 3=C...
